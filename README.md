This project is described on Free Code Camp's site under TwitchTV JSON API. It can be found at: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api
A user visiting the website can see a list of accounts of people they're following and see if these accounts exist, if they're offline or online. If online, they can go to that account's stream but also see what is being streamed in the viewer.
This project will first be built with Atom and stored on Github at: https://github.com/testinnplayin/twitchy/
This project will not be placed on CodePen unlike the others due to an issue with how the API now works. The way this API worked has been changed so that only registered Twitch TV users can use it. As a result, the clientID key has been removed from the version of this app on GitHub. Please contact me with any questions related to this app.
